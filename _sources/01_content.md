Data, Visualisation and Reporting with Python
=============================================

The objective of this course is to provide ways and tools to obtain data online and to visualise its structure for reporting purposes. All will be done using [python](https://www.python.org), an established programming language for statistics and data science providing a multitude of libraries readily available for use. This ever developing collection of libraries, many of which offer a simple plug-and-play in the use of rather advanced functionality, enables one to load data from online sources, smoothly handle and analyse it and leave static images for reporting behind.

The outline of this course shall be as follows:

- general remarks on python and its installation
- building a solid foundation in basic python
- data visualisation
- online data collection
- Reporting using interactive dashboards
