    "Jupyter notebooks are html based which, beyond other features, enables to work with [**Markdown**](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) directly inside cells. Markdown in general is a lightweight markup language, designed for easy formatting of plain text (like html is a markup language for browser content).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make use of markdown formatting in jupyter notebooks, we need to convert the (standard) code cells to markdown cells. We can do so by selecting a cell (blue cell frame) and pressing *m* on the keyboard. Alternatively, click on *Cell* in the menu bar, navigate to *Cell Type* and select *Markdown*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a markdown cell is run, the text and styling/formatting commands will be translated to html: the content will be displayed according to applied rules. The formatting commands are added in the text and usually include (a pair of) *special characters* like asterisks, hyphens or underscores. Conveniently, the respective formatting is mostly applied dynamically when typing (or otherwise highlighted by different coloring), not only after the cell is run.\n",
