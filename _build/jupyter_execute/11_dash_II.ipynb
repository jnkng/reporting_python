    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide advanced interactivity and reactivity, that is to let new input trigger modified output, we need to provide the content as the result of a function.\n",
    "We can have several functions, each modifying one specific element of the UI. To reference elements in the UI and the server part, we give a unique **id** to each element. This id is handed to the respective function to tell it that this is the **input** to be used. The same applies in the reversed direction: by specifying the id of the desired UI element as a function's **output**, the created result is passed to the right address to be displayed. \n",
    "The declaration of what is input and output is done using [decorators](Decorators) and callbacks. This decorator takes the input and output ids as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure for building an advanced reactive app becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a JupyterDash object\n",
    "\n",
    "- define the UI by using the `.layout()` method:\n",
    "    - static elements are defined here\n",
    "    - every interactive item gets an unique **id** which will identify the element as it is given to the server/UI. For example: An info text, which will not change during the use of the app would not need an id. A button to alter the content must get an id.\n",
    "\n",
    "- define the server functions for the content and use the `app.callback()` decorator.\n",
    "    - this part will do any calculations or assignments for interactive elements. The output created here also gets an **id** to address it in the UI in order to display it at the desired location. The definition as callback ensures that every time an input changes, the respective function (having this element as input) is run to keep the content of the UI up-to-date, e.g. after clicking a button  \n",
    "    \n",
    "- the app is run using the `.run_server()` method\n",
    "\n",
    " Note that expensive operations like (down)loading a file should be placed outside the reactive environment, if possible. Else, the operation is triggered and run every time the input changes. For example when working with APIs: Place the request and loading of the data once upfront, before starting the app. Otherwise, the request will be sent unnecessarily for every change in input and soon the limit of requests per day is reached. In general, don't change global variables inside the reactive environment."
